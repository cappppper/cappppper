## 💡 About

Hi! Here is Cappppper. I mainly focus on common Computer Vision topics including object detection and image segmentation, etc. 

When I'm free, I enjoy [📖 reading](), watching [🎬 movies]() and [📺 anime](), and listening to [🎧 music](). I also work on useful/useless side projects from time to time.

If you're interested, please checkout my personal [✏️ blog](https://www.tenire.com) where I share my ordinary yet joyful life. 

Feel free to contact me via <a href="mailto:i@tenire.com">Email</a> or [Telegram](https://t.me/itenire).
